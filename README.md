# Soil-Lab-Calculator-Telegram-Bot
A Python-based Telegram chatbot for calculating various soil properties in geotechnical engineering laboratories. The bot simplifies tedious manual calculations, enhances accuracy, and provides instant results based on user inputs.
## üöÄ Key Features  

- **Automated Soil Property Calculations**:  
  - Moisture Content  
  - Atterberg Limits (Liquid Limit, Plastic Limit, Plasticity Index)  
  - Shrinkage Properties (Shrinkage Limit, Volumetric Shrinkage, Linear Shrinkage)  
  - AASHTO and Unified Soil Classifications  
  - Density and Compaction (CBR, Specific Gravity, Moisture-Density Relationship)  
  - Hydrometer and Mechanical Analysis  

- **Interactive Telegram Bot Interface**  
  - Accepts user inputs dynamically.  
  - Provides instant, accurate results.  

- **Real-World Application**:  
  - Built for geotechnical lab use cases and educational purposes.
